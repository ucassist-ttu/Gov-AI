With a recidivism rate of 86% in our surrounding rural county jails and a recidivism rate of nearly 50% in our state prisons, we decided to turn our vision into a mission. We started with an outreach discipleship class once a week, and we volunteered to take them to services and provide the means to pay for the services. After a few years of experience helping after incarceration, research and development, and training with multiple re-entry programs, we opened the doors to our first re-entry home in 2019!",
