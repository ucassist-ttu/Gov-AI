## Project Overview
The UCDD Resource Portal is a full-stack web application designed to centralize community resources, improve accessibility for providers and clients, and enhance user experience through intelligent features and interactive tools.
This platform replaces the client’s existing WordPress website with a custom-built solution that integrates modern web technologies, an AI-driven chatbot, and dynamic data management. The site is designed for three main user groups — Clients, Providers, and Community Members — each with tailored features and permissions.
